# HTML META Tags for SEO

This project contains an HTML file designed to improve the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and social media presence of your web pages. You can find all META tags and necessary elements in `META-TAGS.html`.

## Purpose

The HTML metadata block enhances the visibility of your web pages in search engine results and improves how they appear when shared on social media platforms. It includes various meta tags that define page properties, keywords, descriptions, and social media information.

## How to Use

Replace the placeholder texts in the HTML blocks with your specific content. The placeholders to replace are:

   - `__TITLE__`: The title of your web page.
   - `__KEYWORDS__`: Keywords relevant to your content, separated by commas.
   - `__DESCRIPTION__`: A concise description of your web page.
   - `__WEB_SITE_NAME__`: The name of your website.
   - `__COPY_RIGHT__`: Your copyright information, e.g., "Â© 2024, Your Company Name. All Rights Reserved."
   - `__DOMAIN__`: The domain extension of your website, e.g., "com", "net", "io".
   - `__TWITTER_PROFILE__`: Your Twitter profile handle, e.g., "@YourTwitterHandle".
   - `__THEME_COLOR__`: The theme color of your website in hexadecimal format, e.g., "#FF7400".
   - `__IMAGE_URL__`: URL of the image used for social media previews and cards (preferably a `.gif`).

Replace the favicon image files with yours in `IMAGE` folder. **The size of images must not be change and remain same!**
